ÂµDIC: A toolkit for digital image correlation
=======================================

This project aims at providing a "batteries included" toolktit for digital image correlation in Python.
The functionality you need to perform digital image correaltion on experimental data as 
well as for doing vitrual experiments are included.

The main components:
------------------------------------
We have contructed the toolkit as a set of packages where each package provides a isolated set of tools:


* IO-Tools
* Virtual Lab
    * Speckle generation tools
    * Image deformation tools
    * Noise injection tools
    * Image downsampling tools
* Mesh generation
    * A light weight GUI for structured meshing
    * B-spline elements
        * Arbitrary polynomial order
        * Knot vectors can be manipulated
* Image correlation routines:
    * Non linear least squares solver
* Post processor
    * Calculates most popular strain measures
    * Light weight visualization

* Test suites
    * Automated function tests
 

Our motivation
--------------
The motivation for this work was the need for a transparent code which could be 
modified and extended easly, without digging deep into C or C++ source code. 
The implementation is pure python with the exception of third-party packages such 
as Scipy, Numy etc.
